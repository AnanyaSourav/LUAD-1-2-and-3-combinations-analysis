# LUAD-1--2--and-3--combinations-analysis
This repository contains code and resources for multi-omics integration and survival modeling in lung adenocarcinoma (TCGA-LUAD) patients. The project investigates prognostic modeling using Cox proportional hazards regression applied to single-omics, pairwise, and triple-omics data combinations.

The work was extended with a post-hoc incremental analysis pipeline, designed to evaluate performance improvements over the best single-omics baseline, visualize trade-offs between model complexity and predictive accuracy, and summarize confidence interval overlaps.
